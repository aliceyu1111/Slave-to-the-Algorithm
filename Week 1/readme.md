Having absolutely zero knowledge of the coding world, I’m actually really excited into developing my understanding of the processes involved and hopefully through this studio will alter the way I think about digital design and how it can be incorporated into my future artworks.  

During class time, Karen mentioned the terms generative and parametric design, which were completing foreign words to me. So, I decided to do some further reading on these terms to further strengthen my understanding. It quickly became quite clear that the dominate industries who use generative and parametric design to their advantage are engineering and architectural designers.  

Generative Design: When an individual creates a set of parameters (size, weight, height, strength) into a generative design program, in which the algorithms will create the optimal solutions that would have otherwise been impossible for the human mind to curate. From these solutions, it is up to the designers to further filter and alter the parameters until a suitable solution is generated.  

For engineers, this technology method allows them to no longer be constrained by their imaginations or previous experiences. They are able to collaborate with the technology to produce new ideas that in the long run benefit the environment as well as reducing cost and increase in productivity and production.  

In summary generative design is “thinking about designing not the object – but a process to generate objects” - Michael Hansmeyer 

Parametric Design: Similar to generative design it requires a designer to calculate specific parameters such as materials, site constraints as well as environmental factors. However parametric design allows designers to alter projects in real-time, which allows designers to seek multiple options before making the final cut.  

So, what's the difference between the two? 

Reading from Karen’s notes, to me this makes the most sense. “parametric design is dependent on variables that alter the geometry or other factors (like a template), while generative design creates new objects or visuals where there were not any before (as if you are growing something).
