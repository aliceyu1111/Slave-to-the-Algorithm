# Week 6

This week we touched base on what sort of area we would group ourselves in according to our presentations pitch and intended goals and ideas. I placed myself somewhere in-between sensory data and sound, however the more I think about my approach, the more I want to focus on the visual aspects of the project, whilst including sound as a background approach to further elevate my overall concept.  

Also, during the first half of the class, Andy got us to quickly do a paper prototype of an arcade video game within 10mins. This was a super fun exercise and it got us think about how we can present our ideas through a paper prototype not only for this class, but for future projects as well. This prototype was based on Super Mario 

During the second half of the class, Karen showed us how to use P5.js which is different to Java. We learnt how to incorporate sound into a simple piece of artwork, which was actually pretty cool! Although the annoying thing I’m still trying to get over is the fact that if you enter one word or letter incorrectly your whole code doesn’t work. Super frustrating, but I’m learning to take deep breaths in-between. (Okay and some meditation in-between as well heheh) It was fun getting to learn how to incorporate sound and how we can make that volume of the sound affect and change the circle shape within the artwork. This is something I might try to incorporate into my code later down the track. 

### Idea Time!!!!!!

**As for further ideas development, I firstly wrote down a list of things that I think represent what my project is.**  

No patterns - because notifications come at random times 

Complete randomness 

Distractions  

Avoidance 

Alert!!! 

Alarming! - some more than others ngl 

Places on emotions 

Hypnotizing 

Brainwashed 

Controlled 

Data 

Overwhelming ??? 


**1st Idea???** 

The idea of raindrops. Plays on the idea of impermanence. Notifications don’t have a lasting impression on us. Social reminders that we are still here. We exist. Because when unexpected rain touches us, it jolts us in a way to act. Example beginning to run, or walk a little faster to get out of rain, cover our heads with our clothes or an umbrella.   

Processing rain or how like water drips onto paper towels. It leaves a mark but eventually it dries up. Notifications are not that important??? 

The more times the notification appears in a row from the same app, the color could deepen??? 



**2nd Idea** 

Idea of a spinning record player or just a circular spinning artboard. The more notifications that appear the faster it spins and the more colour drips onto the CD cover. By the end have a colourful arrangement of colours . The spinning would also act as a hypnotizing effect as well.  

One piece would take up to around 24 mins.  

Every hr has x amount of notifications. So therefore, every 1min = 1hr of the day.  

1min = speed of turning wheel depending on how many notifications occur within an hr. If there is a lot, the faster it spins, and vice versa.  

1min = number of drops, again depending on number of notifications 

Every drop colour will be different depending on what app it came from.  

 

Here is a simple sketch that I drew out to help with my explanation.
