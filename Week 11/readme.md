# Week 11

After receiving the code that Karen fixed for me, things were running smoothly once again. The data was able to change according to the days! Yipeee

After speaking with Andy during our class breakout rooms, he suggested I remove all the clutter, such as the title of the days on the bottom and make the pattern more the focal point and larger across the canvas. Since my project was to make an artwork from the data, was it really necessary to put other info on the canvas, when it could be placed in a short description underneath the artwork. 

For this week, since majority of my code is about finished, I wanted to add and play with it more. At the moment I do feel as though it is a bit static for the viewer, as all they can do it change the pattern from a button or just change the days data. I wanted there to be more an interactive perspective, which is something I hadn't really thought about until now. With the interactive element, the artwork would be unique to them only. So I've decided to incorporate the use of sliders in my work. 

**As of now, I want the sliders to be able to do the following:**
1. Change the colour of the dots in their respective groups. So one slider would control the circles that represent the Instagram data and etc.
2. Be able to change the shapes. So from circle to square and vise versa
3. To be able to change the whole pattern size.... Ugh this is kind of hard to explain, so if I get this running, I'll show this through a GIF hehe
4. Was think about opacity of the shapes, but not really essential... Might play round with this idea...
