# Feedback from Week 10

After speaking with Andy during our class breakout rooms, he suggested I remove all the clutter, such as the title of the days on the bottom and make the pattern more the focal point and larger across the canvas. He also suggested that I change up the colours a bit more to have more contrast, which is something I'll also have a play around with. Since my project was to make an artwork from the data, was it really necessary to put other info on the canvas, when it could be placed in a short description underneath the artwork. 

### Goals For This Week!
1. Decluttered all the unnecessary information on the canvas and make the pattern fill up more space
2. Get Karen to help me with my code in terms of the data visualisation changing whenever I selected the days. So far it's stuck on one day only
3. Understand the edits Karen made to my code and why
4. Include sliders within my code so the artwork becomes more interactive
5. Add a save image button
6. Experiment with using different colours
7. Include a pause button instead of keyPressed function
8. Consider doing a landing page before diving into the artwork. Good way of introducing the project and giving it more of a backstory
9. Design a logo for the project
10. Design a hero image for the project
11. Write an Artist Statement!


# Progress for the week!
After receiving the code that Karen fixed for me, things were running smoothly once again. The data was able to change according to the days! Yipeee

For this week, since majority of my code is about finished, I wanted to add and play with it more. At the moment I do feel as though it is a bit static for the viewer, as all they can do it change the pattern from a button or just change the days data. I wanted there to be more an interactive perspective, which is something I hadn't really thought about until now. With the interactive element, the artwork would be unique to them only. So I've decided to incorporate the use of sliders in my work. 

**As of now, I want the sliders to be able to do the following:**
1. Change the colour of the dots in their respective groups. So one slider would control the circles that represent the Instagram data and etc.
2. Be able to change the shapes. So from circle to square and vise versa
3. To be able to change the whole pattern size.... Ugh this is kind of hard to explain, so if I get this running, I'll show this through a GIF hehe
4. Was think about opacity of the shapes, but not really essential... Might play round with this idea...

Okay I figured out how to use the sliders to change the colour of the circles! First time I did it, the shapes where a little to big, so for Friday and Saturday data, it was just blobs of the one colour, which wasn't particularily interesting. Also it seems as though the opacity only goes down to a certain level. This was the lowest I could get it and it still wasn't as opaque as before.

However when I adjusted the sizes in my code, the pattern seemed to look much more interesting!

I used these to help me with the code https://p5js.org/examples/hello-p5-interactivity-2.html and https://editor.p5js.org/aferriss/sketches/ryBzOKMQm


# Landing Page & Logo Design Development
I started to think about a landing page to give a little introduction into my artwork and to provide a space where people have the option to click a link that will lead them to anther space where they can get a bit more of a backstory of the idea and concept behind the project. 
I also designed a logo for this project as well using a simple font. Ideally I would like to have the slider on the word Notify to operate and unlock the landing page to the interactive artwork, but not entirely sure how to go about coding that... so the backup option is to just have a button that you would mousepress or keypress to start the artwork. Also I've searched on the web, and it doesn't seem very likely for a kerning option to be applied to the text either, so I may just have to insert an image of the logo onto p5.js. However I'm thinking of incorporating the word Addiction by using the wiggly letter style that we learn't in class. Might add some interest on the landing page.

### Things To Consider For Next Week
1. Possibly including another slidered that allows the circles to change into squares and the squares to changes into circles
2. How to make the code operate on my phone. I remember Karen mentioning last class how when you shake the phone, it will generate a new pattern. Will need to do some further research on this!!!
3. Possibly include a link in the landing page so that users can be redirected to another page that explains more indepth about the project
