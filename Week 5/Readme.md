# Week 5
### Presentations, Presentations, Presentations!
 

This week I got to see what other students in my class had developed as their ideas for their presentation pitch. I was so impressed the amount of creativity and experimentation that everyone was able to come up with and produce. No two pitch ideas were the same and there was a good balance between computer based generative design and non-computer based generative design. There was a lot of ideas running through my head as I was listening to other people and what I could potentially explore further as a result. Before I was mainly focusing on digital work to represent my data but I was still open to seeking more ideas on how I could present my data in a more non-digital aspect. The 2 presentations about representing data on tapestry was really intriguing to me, and left me wondering how on earth did you even think about that!? Aha  

Anyway, at the moment I am still content with my idea and I have started to record my notifications history on my phone into a spreadsheet format which I had to conduct manually since the app on IFTTT didn’t quite operate unfortunately. I only recorded my notifications history for a week and managed to label things based on type of app it came from. I only switched on the notifications alert on apps I use on a daily basis. Some were more frequent than others obviously. The most notifications I received from an app was from the Messenger app, followed by Snapchat then Instagram. There was the occasional emails and Facebook notifications.  

It’s interesting to see the results now as well, since I believe they vastly differ to life pre-COVID or pre-lockdown. I know that I used to get a lot more notification on Facebook groups, but since lockdown these group activities have become a bit more dormant. Also, I probably wouldn’t get this much social media notifications, but since a lot of my friends don’t work anymore due to lockdown, they’ve become more social media active.  

I think I would like to compare these results to maybe the results after lockdown and as things start to become more “normal” if that were to ever happen. But as of this moment I think I'll stick with these results and see what we could do with them from there.  

The data was recorded from Sunday 16th of August to Sunday 23rd of August
