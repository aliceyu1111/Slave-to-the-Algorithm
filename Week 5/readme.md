# Week 5
### Presentations, Presentations, Presentations!
 

This week I got to see what other students in my class had developed as their ideas for their presentation pitch. I was so impressed the amount of creativity and experimentation that everyone was able to come up with and produce. No two pitch ideas were the same and there was a good balance between computer based generative design and non-computer based generative design. There was a lot of ideas running through my head as I was listening to other people and what I could potentially explore further as a result. Before I was mainly focusing on digital work to represent my data but I was still open to seeking more ideas on how I could present my data in a more non-digital aspect. The 2 presentations about representing data on tapestry was really intriguing to me, and left me wondering how on earth did you even think about that!? Aha  

### Notes from my Presentation
**Title: Notify My Addiction**

**What** 

“Notify My Addiction” is a data driven generative artwork that experiments on the lights and sounds of our notifications on our phone throughout the day and how they affect and influence our moods and behaviour. From these different vibrations and sounds we can generate a piece of music code accompanied by visuals to represent the data in an engaging format.  

 

**Why** 

The smarter our technological advances have become over the years, the more obsessed and focused we are on these new devices we now call as our phones. Whilst it may have dramatically simplified and improved our lives, it has also created a new and dangerous addiction.  

The notification/alerts we receive on our phones distract and control our emotions so much so that we avoid any current responsibilities at a certain given time to attend these notifications. Examples such as checking our phones whilst driving, crossing the road, or even at work.  

It raises the question of how much is a notification on your phone worth? Was it worth risking you or someone else's life? Was it worth risking your job? Or even a friendship?  

How much control does your phone have over you and how does it dictate your everyday life? Think about all the times you immediately stopped what you were doing just to check a notification on your phone. Essentially I want to create a design that explores the relationship between a human and their phone. 

**Inspiration Spark** 

Black Mirror – Nosedive 

It explores this Utopian reality where your phone and online status literally determines the value and worth of your life. It focuses on how technology can shape and form your behavior and reactions to situations and interactions with people as well.  

 

**Case Study 1: Daniel Canogar – Billow** 

Canogar’s latest work Billows analysis's the data from Google search trends in real – time and is then applied to a sculptures format, in which the colours represent different popular word phrases. As the phrase grows more popular, the warmer the colour becomes. I really appreciate how he is able represent theses data in an abstract format that is quite mesmerizing to watch, which is something I would like to ultimately achieve. It also gives off a hypnosis vibe, which again is something I’m thinking of incorporating into my design, as it eludes to the theory of how we as a generation are being hypnotised by out computer screens and how the notifications are there to pull us back to the virtual world.  

 

**Case Study 2: Brian House - Quotidian Record** 

This project consists of the idea of how our travel patterns have inherent musical qualities. House created a 11min vinyl record that features a continuous year of his location-tracking data. Again, this shows another unique way of representing data driven generative work in a non-software artwork form which is something I also wanted to explore. This is a good reminder that not all generative artworks need to be based on a computer screen.  

 

**Case Study 3: thedotisblack Creative Coding – Sounds of Space** 

Each audio visual is made with processing, in which it is based on the recordings of NASA’s Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts, and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory for the Sun. The patterns and frequency ranges explored in processing is quite interesting to watch and has a really unique design that I would like to achieve.  

 

**How** 

Since my project focuses on using data to formulate the base of an artwork, the programs that may help me to gather and create the data would be: 

IFTTT and Temboo. This allows me to gather data not only from myself, but hopefully from other people as well to get a wider range of data collection and hopefully to create a unique output that’s engaging and insightful. I did come across an application on IFTTT that’s very similar to what I was searching for.  

I also found another applet that loges every notification I receive, which may generate some interesting data as well.  

 

Since I also wanted to experiment with the different pitch and sounds of different notifications according to the apps, I also looked at a program called Magenta. So, they are an open source python library that helps to create art and music using NoteSequences. It’s an abstract representation of a series of notes, and I think this might create some interesting sounds from the data that I’m currently collecting.  

Lastly processing is another program that I will continue to develop and learn new skills from and to experiment with. Within this processing, I intend to achieve an artwork that engages the audience with mesmerising and unique visuals paired with audio. 


### After Class Thoughts

Anyway, at the moment I am still content with my idea and I have started to record my notifications history on my phone into a spreadsheet format which I had to conduct manually since the app on IFTTT didn’t quite operate unfortunately. I only recorded my notifications history for a week and managed to label things based on type of app it came from. I only switched on the notifications alert on apps I use on a daily basis. Some were more frequent than others obviously. The most notifications I received from an app was from the Messenger app, followed by Snapchat then Instagram. There was the occasional emails and Facebook notifications.  

It’s interesting to see the results now as well, since I believe they vastly differ to life pre-COVID or pre-lockdown. I know that I used to get a lot more notification on Facebook groups, but since lockdown these group activities have become a bit more dormant. Also, I probably wouldn’t get this much social media notifications, but since a lot of my friends don’t work anymore due to lockdown, they’ve become more social media active.  

I think I would like to compare these results to maybe the results after lockdown and as things start to become more “normal” if that were to ever happen. But as of this moment I think I'll stick with these results and see what we could do with them from there.  

The data was recorded from Sunday 16th of August to Sunday 23rd of August

There was a big spike on Thursday and Saturday, but the data didn’t really follow any pattern as the results for me seemed quite random. The notifications would be based on what was happening in my life and my friend's life at that particular given day, which would lead to certain amount of notifications. For Thursday and Saturday, I didn’t initiate any sort of major events or surprises that would lead to this many notifications, but some exciting things did happen to my friends lives such as a change in hairstyle or a discussion on topics that their passionate about.   

Also, I did unmute my notifications from vibrate to ringtone, and I realized that each app has their own unique notification sound, some a bit louder than others, and some a bit more subtle and calming. My email notification sound had the best sound to me since it sounded less “urgent” compared to my snapchat and messenger's app did. I did eventually turn it back to vibrate since the alerts were starting to annoy me like a lot! And it was extremely distracting when you are trying to focus on everything but your phone.  

### Artists Inspiration
**Micheala Gleave**

After my presentation, Karen mentioned that I should look into an Australian artist called Micheala Gleave. Upon looking at her previous works, the one that stood out the most to me and I believe applies to my project concept the most was “A Galaxy of Suns”  

https://michaelagleave.com/a-galaxy-of-suns-video/ You can check out the video here! 

Basically, the project involves tracking the earths motions through space and records our position in relation to space and the stars. From the data gathered, it then creates sounds and visual ques that are specific to that location in space and time. It’s so interesting and the sounds and rhythms produced are so calming as well.
