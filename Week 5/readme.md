# Week 5
### Presentations, Presentations, Presentations!
 

This week I got to see what other students in my class had developed as their ideas for their presentation pitch. I was so impressed the amount of creativity and experimentation that everyone was able to come up with and produce. No two pitch ideas were the same and there was a good balance between computer based generative design and non-computer based generative design. There was a lot of ideas running through my head as I was listening to other people and what I could potentially explore further as a result. Before I was mainly focusing on digital work to represent my data but I was still open to seeking more ideas on how I could present my data in a more non-digital aspect. The 2 presentations about representing data on tapestry was really intriguing to me, and left me wondering how on earth did you even think about that!? Aha  

Anyway, at the moment I am still content with my idea and I have started to record my notifications history on my phone into a spreadsheet format which I had to conduct manually since the app on IFTTT didn’t quite operate unfortunately. I only recorded my notifications history for a week and managed to label things based on type of app it came from. I only switched on the notifications alert on apps I use on a daily basis. Some were more frequent than others obviously. The most notifications I received from an app was from the Messenger app, followed by Snapchat then Instagram. There was the occasional emails and Facebook notifications.  

It’s interesting to see the results now as well, since I believe they vastly differ to life pre-COVID or pre-lockdown. I know that I used to get a lot more notification on Facebook groups, but since lockdown these group activities have become a bit more dormant. Also, I probably wouldn’t get this much social media notifications, but since a lot of my friends don’t work anymore due to lockdown, they’ve become more social media active.  

I think I would like to compare these results to maybe the results after lockdown and as things start to become more “normal” if that were to ever happen. But as of this moment I think I'll stick with these results and see what we could do with them from there.  

The data was recorded from Sunday 16th of August to Sunday 23rd of August

There was a big spike on Thursday and Saturday, but the data didn’t really follow any pattern as the results for me seemed quite random. The notifications would be based on what was happening in my life and my friend's life at that particular given day, which would lead to certain amount of notifications. For Thursday and Saturday, I didn’t initiate any sort of major events or surprises that would lead to this many notifications, but some exciting things did happen to my friends lives such as a change in hairstyle or a discussion on topics that their passionate about.   

Also, I did unmute my notifications from vibrate to ringtone, and I realized that each app has their own unique notification sound, some a bit louder than others, and some a bit more subtle and calming. My email notification sound had the best sound to me since it sounded less “urgent” compared to my snapchat and messenger's app did. I did eventually turn it back to vibrate since the alerts were starting to annoy me like a lot! And it was extremely distracting when you are trying to focus on everything but your phone.  

### Artists Inspiration
**Micheala Gleave**

After my presentation, Karen mentioned that I should look into an Australian artist called Micheala Gleave. Upon looking at her previous works, the one that stood out the most to me and I believe applies to my project concept the most was “A Galaxy of Suns”

Basically, the project involves tracking the earths motions through space and records our position in relation to space and the stars. From the data gathered, it then creates sounds and visual ques that are specific to that location in space and time. It’s so interesting and the sounds and rhythms produced are so calming as well.
