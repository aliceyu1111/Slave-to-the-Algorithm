# Week 8

# Class Overview

This week we had a look through the paper prototypes of our classmates and to see the progress of their works. Again, there was a lot of creativity and interesting projects that Iâ€™m excited to see!  

For the second half of the class, Karen showed us how to use the sound to affect what was happening on screen. More specifically, how what we were saying was being translated into words on the computer screen, kind of like having our own subtitles.  


# This Week WIP
I discovered this example on openprocessing

I felt that this one was more on point to what I had imagined my project to look like, compared to the liquid simulation that I found. One of the main reasons was that the liquid simulation code did appear to be quite pixilated and slow in the process compared to this one, and I was struggling quite a bit in relation to trying to alter changes to suit my project as well.  

Here I attempted to make changes to the original code to make it more my own. Not much progress has happened to be honest. The only thing I added was the sphere in the center. My next goal is to somehow get rid of the background and only have the moving fluid within the sphere. I'm still feeling a little shaky with this idea...
