# Week 9

# Class Overview
This week was all about presenting our progress to the class and to see how everyone's project was developing. Once again I was pretty impressed with everyone's ideas and the direction they were heading in. Meanwhile I was still on shaky grounds. My code is still in the developmental stages and I'm still trying to figure out what my overall result would look like. As of my now, my paper prototype has changed from the first one, in which I have decided to further simplify my work.

In this paper prototype I was thinking of displaying the data in a circle to represent the hours of the day. The dots represent the notifications and they would be plotted around the circle depending on when the notifications appeared throughout the day. The sizes of the dots would depend on how many notifications were received within that hour. As of now, getting the dots arranged in a circle and getting them to reflect the data in my JSON file seems far out of my reach, so as of continuing on for next week, I'll start of simple and easy and build from there. 

# Inspirational Work

**Artist:** Adil Rabbani
**Project Title:** Visualizing Pi in p5.js
**Reference:** https://adilrabbani.github.io/experiments/GenerativeArt/VisualizingPi.html
This work is based off Daniel Shiffman's "Visualizing 1 million digits of Pi", in which the numbers from 0-9 are given different colours which are mapped around a circle. The numbers are connected across the circle through a line and the dots represent the occurence of two consecutive digits. In terms of this project, I really appreciate the simple asethetics of the overall design and the use of data to affect the colours of the lines and their positioning as well. I think it's quite similar to my project and it's something that I'll keep in mind when I'm coding my work.
