# Week 9

# Class Overview
This week was all about presenting our progress to the class and to see how everyone's project was developing. Once again I was pretty impressed with everyone's ideas and the direction they were heading in. Meanwhile I was still on shaky grounds. My code is still in the developmental stages and I'm still trying to figure out what my overall result would look like. As of my now, my paper prototype has changed from the first one, in which I have decided to further simplify my work.
