# Week 7

# Class Overview 

This week, we each delivered a 1min presentation based on our final idea and what steps we had already taken and what we needed to do next.  

We also got the opportunity to do a paper-mockup of our project as well. I did mine through procreate and just edited it all into a gif as I feel it explains my idea clearer. The overall concept is still the same as to my pitch during week 5.  

The work will be carried through the use of p5.js, in which I will attempt to code this liquid motion effect to create this psychedelic feel to reflect how the idea of notifications are creating hallucinations and altering the way we perceive reality. The rules of the fluidity, density and diffusion is something I hope I can alter and achieve for each individual circle that represents an hour of the day.

We also learnt how to write a pseudo code in class as well. Mine was: 

FUNCTION “Brushing Hair” 

DO brush knots out 

~~IF hair is knot free~~ – You don’t need to ask IF because hair is already knot free (redunct line) 

THEN braid hair down on right side 

RETURN to braid hair down left side 

END IF 


Towards the last hour of class, Karen showed us an interesting way of playing around with typography in p5.js!

# Homework Task 

Our task for the week was to create a pseudo code for our own project.  

**Pseudo Code** 

FUNCTION “Notification Tracking Data” 

INPUT Notification data within 24hrs  

IF notifications per/hr ≤ 30-40 = large dot 

ELSE IF notification per/hr ≥ 30-40 = medium dot 

WHILE notification per/hr between 5-20 = small dot 

DO nothing if no notifications exist within an hr 

THEREFORE, large dot = high density and fast diffusion 

WHILST medium dot = medium density and average diffusion 

THEN small dot = Low density and slow diffusion 

DO separate dot colour by usage of app  

DO let dots intertwin and blend with each other 

IF Instagram, make colour purple 

IF Messenger, make colour pink 

IF Snapchat, make colour yellow 

IF Facebook, make colour blue 

IF Email, make colour green 

LET time determine location of dot on canvas 

END IF 

 


Since I’ve recorded data for a whole week, given if I have time, I thought it would be interesting to compare throughout the week which app you received the most notifications from based on colour. Also, due the amount of colour on the canvas, it will give somewhat an idea into how busy your phone usage was as well.  

I also tried to do some more research into p5.js by watching a couple of Dan Shiffman’s YouTube Videos as well as looking up some references on p5.js and through Github 


# What I have learnt or discovered this week through my own research 

How to code an array of things onto p5.js 

How to incorporate a google spreadsheet onto p5.js using ‘loadtable’ function 

How to convert a google docs spreadsheet into JSON 

How to check whether your JSON code is valid by going to JSON Formatter and Validator 

How to input JSON code into p5.js through loadJSON(); 

Daniel Shiffan did a Youtube video on Fluid Stimulation based on Mike Ash’s code and it looks super intense and confusing and a verrrry long code as well 

Discovered a thing called a Reaction Diffusion which is used through Pixel Flow. I think this may help me with my project as it is based on similar ideas. 

Watched a video on Reaction Diffusion. I thought it would better if I started to understand this a bit better to give me confidence on moving forward? 

 

# What I am struggling with this week? 

The thing I’m mostly struggling right now is how I can extract the data that I have from my JSON file into p5.js. Not only that but how do I then create a moving animation that is defined by the data?  

I’ve looked at a lot of YouTube videos, and quite a few are based on API data rather than JSON.  

Also, I feel like I’m slowly adjusting and learning new things on p5.js, but similar issues as above, where I don’t really have a clue how I can combine different types of coding into one functional code if that makes sense? So, I would attempt to create a code that uses noiseSeed, but I can’t figure out how to add another effect onto it without it misfunctioning.
