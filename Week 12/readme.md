# Week 12
Final Project Link! https://aliceyu1111.github.io/Slave-to-the-Algorithm/Week%2012/NotifyMyAddiction/

# Feedback
1. Make the elements on the page adjust to the browser window. (When Andy and Karen opened the link, the landing page was off centered!)
2. Consider a more fluid response to the UI elements on the page. Right now it feels like a last minute add on
3. Consider using some sort of sounds within the project. Maybe using a piano melody. Something quirky and lyrical

# Tasks For This Week!
1. Get the elements on the page fitting central on all browsers. This is done through using width and height instead of just coordinate numbers
2. Design a more interesting aesthetic placement for the UI elements. Be more considerate
3. Attempt to transition artwork to also work on a mobile device
4. Keep experimenting to see what other things you can do with the sliders. Control rotating the squares maybe?
5. Search through some music and see if it works with project
6. Continue to work on Artist Statement
7. Combine WIP documents in PDF file for submission

# WIP 
Alright so, getting all my elements to adjust central on all browser sizes took some times to recategorise my objects, but we got there in there in the end! Also sent a link out to some of my friends to see if it worked on their monitor and it did! Unfortunately did run out of time in trying to correct the issue with displaying it on a mobile device screen. 
I also attempted incorporating using a slider to control the rotating my squares, but somehow kept running into the issue of that whenever my slider was on the right hand side, not all shapes would appear within the screen... Couldn't really figure out the issue, so decided to leave this out as I decided to focus on other elements that I could resolve. 


### Experimenting with different UI layouts
