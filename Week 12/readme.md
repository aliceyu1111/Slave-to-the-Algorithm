# Week 12

# Feedback
1. Make the elements on the page adjust to the browser window. (When Andy and Karen opened the link, the landing page was off centered!)
2. Consider a more fluid response to the UI elements on the page. Right now it feels like a last minute add on
3. Consider using some sort of sounds within the project. Maybe using a piano melody. Something quirky and lyrical

# Tasks For This Week!
1. Get the elements on the page fitting central on all browsers. This is done through using width and height instead of just coordinate numbers
2. Design a more interesting aesthetic placement for the UI elements. Be more considerate
3. Attempt to transition artwork to also work on a mobile device
4. Keep experimenting to see what other things you can do with the sliders. Control rotating the squares maybe?
5. Search through some music and see if it works with project
6. Continue to work on Artist Statement
7. Combine WIP documents in PDF file for submission
