# Week 12
[FINAL PROJECT](https://aliceyu1111.github.io/Slave-to-the-Algorithm/Week%2012/NotifyMyAddiction_Alice/)


# Feedback
1. Make the elements on the page adjust to the browser window. (When Andy and Karen opened the link, the landing page was off centered!)
2. Consider a more fluid response to the UI elements on the page. Right now it feels like a last minute add on
3. Consider using some sort of sounds within the project. Maybe using a piano melody. Something quirky and lyrical

# Tasks For This Week!
1. Get the elements on the page fitting central on all browsers. This is done through using width and height instead of just coordinate numbers
2. Design a more interesting aesthetic placement for the UI elements. Be more considerate
3. Attempt to transition artwork to also work on a mobile device
4. Keep experimenting to see what other things you can do with the sliders. Control rotating the squares maybe?
5. Search through some music and see if it works with project
6. Continue to work on Artist Statement
7. Combine WIP documents in PDF file for submission

# WIP 
Alright so, getting all my elements to adjust central on all browser sizes took some times to recategorise my objects, but we got there in there in the end! Also sent a link out to some of my friends to see if it worked on their monitor and it did! Unfortunately did run out of time in trying to correct the issue with displaying it on a mobile device screen. 
I also attempted incorporating using a slider to control the rotating my squares, but somehow kept running into the issue of that whenever my slider was on the right hand side, not all shapes would appear within the screen... Couldn't really figure out the issue, so decided to leave this out as I decided to focus on other elements that I could resolve.

### Experimenting with different UI layouts

# Reflection
Knowing nothing about the coding world until this studio, I think it’s fair to say I’ve learned quite a lot, but I’ve since then also learned that the coding world is probably not best suited for me. There was definitely a major learning curve to this studio, but I’m so glad that I now understand a bit more about what it takes to code. I now have a better understanding of how a JSON file operates and how to access the information within through coding. I’ve grasped the basic knowledge of drawing up a sketch and learning how to add different elements such as pixel density, to rotate as well as using mouseX, mouseY function to creating interesting effects and unique generative outcomes. Even though my work is far from what I envisioned it would be during the beginning of the studio, I’m still pretty happy with the outcome. 

Overall this class was definitely something that got me out of my comfort zone and really challenged me to think beyond what I was capable of achieveing. I have now discovered a new appreciation for generative and parametric art and all the hardwork behind the scenes. I've acquired new knowledge of the endless possibilities of what one can do with data information and how data doesn't have to be represented in boring graphs and pie charts, but there's so much more inventive ways of going about it. This class has truly opened my mind to another aspect of design that I was too scared of exploring before, but now all I want to do is learn more and see where it takes me in the future. 

In terms of my project, it's not as refined or at a level I was expecting it be, but I'm still pretty happy with the outcome that I was able to achieve. I did struggle at the beginning in terms of writing out my code to work with the JSON file and as my code further progressed, some things got a little easier to understand. But there were definetely times where I felt I was creating more problems rather than solutions, but with the help of Karen and my fellow peers, they made this bumpy journey a little less bumpy. 


# How this project can be further improved
However, given more time, I would have loved to see how I could incorporate movement within my artwork. Such as a subtle motion that would blur the shapes the longer, they were on the canvas, or even being able to mutate the circles into squares with a slider. Also, the slider that I created on the landing page, not only is it resembling the “slide to unlock” function the older iPhone generations had, but at the moment it’s static. Given more time, I would have liked for the slider to actually work and when users slide it across, it would transition the page across to the artwork. I believe to have achieved something like this, I would have needed to explored CSS, therefore allowing me to be able to create customised sliders and buttons. It would also have been nice to include some sort of quirky sound rhythm, but couldn’t quite find a right fit for any of the examples online. Once again given more, I would have liked to generate my own sort of sound based off the notification ringtones to make the final project more interesting and authentic.
