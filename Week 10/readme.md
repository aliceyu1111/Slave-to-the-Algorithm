# Week10
So based on last week class, I decided to continue editing my json data on p5.js, which I'm still trying to wrap my head around converting the data information to code words.



### My Goals for this week!
I also wanted to start a new sketch in which later I can input my data into this sketch. My aim is too start of simple and then build from there. For the past weeks, admitely I have been trying to either alter hard code that I'm not entirely confident with or trying to hybrid two types of code hoping something would happen. (It doesn't) So here goes...

### Friday Night code WIP - STAGE 1 & 2 (Code in Github Respository of Week 10)

I also tried to do "Random Circles with No Code" YouTube tutorial by Dan Shiffman, but to no avail, since I couldn't figure out how to make the circles appear one by one as they do now in this sketch. So I decided to leave it alone for now and move onto something else

I successfully managed to start a new sketch with mousePressed function and add text, but I'm still trying to figure out how I can get the days of the week to continously change, so from Sunday, to Monday and so forth.
