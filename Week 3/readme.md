# Week 3

This week we explored the notion of bio technological drawings and had a look at some artists. I decided to do some further research into these artists in hopes it will inspire me for my upcoming assignments. 

**Artist: Tim Knowles**

In this artwork, Knowles poured the same amount of ink over the pieces of paper all folded identically next to each other and seeing which path the ink falls. This artwork was super simple and yet quite interesting. It reinforced what we discussed in class of how letting nature and gravity take control and seeing what happens and the unique results it can achieve.  

Another of Tim's Projects!

Knowles also did conducted this project which jolted or sparked an idea for what I could propose in week 5. 

**Idea 1** was creating a sound, vibration and motion piece of artwork based on films. So, we would be looking into the soundwaves and patterns of particular films and films genres and how they different from one another.  

**Idea 2** was something that tracks the steps you walk and the path you take. So, like how google maps makes a route from one destination over another. So, the longer you stand at a place, the bigger the circle will become kind of like ink bleeding out on the paper. The longer it's on there the bigger the ink spot. Also, the speed of your walking will indicate the colour changes of the line. So, running would be a bright pink, whilst normal walking would be a light green. This could create an artwork, and everyone would have a slightly different result depending on their day to day life. 

 

Okay okay last one I promise but this seemed really cool!

### Class Activity

Within an hour we were asked to create our own bio technological drawings just through some string, pencils or paint. I had a look around what I had in my room and found an old plastic bag which I ripped up and made handles around a rectangular plastic plate that used to contain Ferrier Rocher chocolates. I attached a ball with a stretchy like string and clicked it all together. The base of the ball was also painted using acrylic paint. I decided to first to hook it on a handle of some sort, but due to lack of wind outside I changed locations, hoping it would work better on a clothesline. It didn’t so had decided to hand move the clothesline back and forth and spin it as well to create some movement. The results were quite interesting.
