# Week 3

This week we explored the notion of bio technological drawings and had a look at some artists. I decided to do some further research into these artists in hopes it will inspire me for my upcoming assignments.Â 

**Artist: Tim Knowles**

In this artwork, Knowles poured the same amount of ink over the pieces of paper all folded identically next to each other and seeing which path the ink falls. This artwork was super simple and yet quite interesting. It reinforced what we discussed in class of how letting nature and gravity take control and seeing what happens and the unique results it can achieve.  

Another of Tim's Projects!
